sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester, and a broad range of switches including database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, accessing the underlying file system, and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

You can visit the [collection of screenshots](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki/Screenshots) demonstrating some of the features on the wiki.

Installation
----

You can download the latest tarball by clicking [here](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/tarball/master) or latest zipball by clicking [here](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/zipball/master).

Preferably, you can download sqlmap by cloning the [Git](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap) repository:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git sqlmap-dev

sqlmap works out of the box with [Python](https://www.python.org/download/) version **2.6**, **2.7** and **3.x** on any platform.

Usage
----

To get a list of basic options and switches use:

    python sqlmap.py -h

To get a list of all options and switches use:

    python sqlmap.py -hh

You can find a sample run [here](https://asciinema.org/a/46601).
To get an overview of sqlmap capabilities, a list of supported features, and a description of all options and switches, along with examples, you are advised to consult the [user's manual](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki/Usage).
    Using the --level and --risk options: These options allow you to specify the level of tests that you want SQLMap to perform and the risk level of the payloads that it will use. For example, you can use the following command to perform a thorough scan using high-risk payloads:

sqlmap -u [URL] --level=5 --risk=3

    Bypassing filters and WAFs: You can use the --tamper option to apply tamper scripts to the payloads generated by SQLMap. This can help you bypass filters and WAFs that are designed to detect and block SQL injection attacks. For example, you can use the following command to apply the "charencode" tamper script to the payloads:

sqlmap -u [URL] --tamper=charencode

    Using the --data and --cookie options: These options allow you to specify POST data and cookies that should be included in the request. This can be useful if the web application requires a login or if the input fields are located in a POST request or in a cookie. For example, you can use the following command to test a login form that requires a username and password:

sqlmap -u [URL] --data="username=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD" --cookie="PHPSESSIONID=COOKIE"

Replace "USERNAME" and "PASSWORD" with the login credentials and "COOKIE" with the value of the PHPSESSIONID cookie.

    Using the --method option: This option allows you to specify the HTTP method that SQLMap should use in the request. By default, SQLMap uses the GET method, but you can use this option to test POST, PUT, and DELETE requests as well. For example, you can use the following command to test a POST request:

sqlmap -u [URL] --method=POST --data="param1=value1&param2=value2"

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
